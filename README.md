There is a bash script application with a contact diary inside, it's connected with a .txt called 'nombre.txt' who allows the bash application to save contacts with a name,surname,email and a phone on the line.Also it's possible search users and ask for help.

To execute the bash script: 1-open a terminal on the folder of the script 2-use "bash script.sh" to inicializate

If you need to login inside the credentials are: User:admin
                                                 Pass:123456
